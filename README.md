# Search Algorithm Comparison

This repository contains a comparison of various search algorithms, including Depth-First Search (DFS), Breadth-First Search (BFS), Greedy Best-First Search (GBFS), and A* Search.

## Overview

The purpose of this repository is to demonstrate the implementation and comparison of different search algorithms. The results include execution time, path cost, and path length for each algorithm.

## Features

- **Algorithms Implemented**:
  - Breadth-First Search (BFS)
  - Depth-First Search (DFS)
  - Greedy Best-First Search (GBFS)
  - A* Search
- **Comparison Metrics**:
  - Execution Time
  - Path Cost
  - Path Length

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/5urabhi/Searching.git
   cd Searching
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Running the Code

To run the comparison, simply execute the `main.py` file:
```sh
python main.py
```

### Results

- The paths found by the algorithms are saved in the `path` folder.
- The comparison charts (execution time, path cost, and path length) are saved in the `charts` folder.

## Examples

Below are example visualizations of the solutions of all four search algorithms:
